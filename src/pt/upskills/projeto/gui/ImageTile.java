 *         ImageTile is the interface required to all "images" used by
 *         ImageMatrixGUI.
 * 
 *         ImageTile is only required to provide the name of the image (e.g.
 *         "XxxX") and its position (in tile coordinates, with 0,0 in the top
 *         left corner and increasing to the right in the horizontal axis and
 *         downwards in the vertical axis). The ImageMatrixGUI will look for an
 *         image with that name in the "images" folder (e.g. "XxxX.png") and
 *         draw that image in the window.
